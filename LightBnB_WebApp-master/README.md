```

- `public` contains all of the HTML, CSS, and client side JavaScript.
  - `index.html` is the entry point to the application. It's the only html page because this is a single page application.
  - `javascript` contains all of the client side javascript files.
    - `index.js` starts up the application by rendering the listings.
    - `network.js` manages all ajax requests to the server.
    - `views_manager.js` manages which components appear on screen.
    - `components` contains all of the individual html components. They are all created using jQuery.
- `sass` contains all of the sass files.
- `server` contains all of the server side and database code.

  - `server.js` is the entry point to the application. This connects the routes to the database.
  - `apiRoutes.js` and `userRoutes.js` are responsible for any HTTP requests to `/users/something` or `/api/something`.
  - `json` is a directory that contains a bunch of dummy data in `.json` files.
  - `database.js` is responsible for all queries to the database. It doesn't currently connect to any database, all it does is return data from `.json` files.

  # LightBnB Project

  We will have to modify the database.js file to have it make queries to our PostgreSQL database instead of JSON files.
